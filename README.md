# Wide ResNet fixer upper

## About 

Correct implementation (well, I hope so) of Wide ResNets based on <a href="https://github.com/meliketoy/wide-resnet.pytorch">meliketoy</a> code

Current best results with same augmentations as in original paper by S.Zagoruyko et al. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07146">PDF</a> for Cifar 10 is 95.77% with dropout p=0.3 and 95.93% without dropouts.


### Installing

Look into requirements.txt
It also uses W&B
